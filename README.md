Data Structures

topics related to computing that are interesting for me:

1. I have been really interested in AI recently and following some of the interesting developements surrounding it. I was reading an economist article about Stephen Thaler who created a machine called DABUS which makes use of multiple nural networks in cooperation, which very closely simulates what our brain does.  It even came out with 2 original inventions without prompting.  The article was called, "The inventor who fell in love with his AI" if you re interested and theres a number of papers that Thaler published on his work

2. the concept is basically another version of his Imagination engine, which uses just 2 AIs, one for brainstorming Ideas, and the other checking them for any amount of usefulness

3. More on the stuff that we are learning I will be interested to learn more about trees and their implementations following taking 231.

4. As this is my first exposure to C++ It will be interesting to see the differences in syntaxt and implementation for different problems from python.  It will be especially interesting learning about how to effectively allocate memory

5. I am not familiar with some of the errors I have heard about with C++ such as a segmentation fault.  Im curious to see what scenarios bring that about and how to avoid it.


topics I feel are difficult now:

1. I have no experience with C++ :)

2. The install process for the compiler was somewhat difficult.  Its hard to know what is happening unless you can see someone else who has already done it.

3. Creating good tests efficiently and effectivley

4. debugging with a debugger, not the worst at it but never was the greatest

5. still getting used to github
